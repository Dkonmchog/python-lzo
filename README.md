# What is LZO ?


LZO is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.
It offers pretty fast compression and *very* fast decompression.
Decompression requires no memory.

In addition there are slower compression levels achieving a quite
competitive compression ratio while still decompressing at
this very high speed.


# What is Python-LZO ?

Python-LZO provides Python bindings for LZO, i.e. you can access
the LZO library from your Python scripts thereby compressing ordinary
Python strings.


# Installation

## Ubuntu Linux

You need the following dependencies installed:
* `zlib1g-dev`
* `liblzo2-dev`
* `python-pip` or `python3-pip`

Then, just `pip install python-lzo`.

These directions are probably the same as debian.  The requirements
are similar for Redhat/centos/etc, but the specific package names
differ.

## macOS

You need XCode installed, or something else that provides suitable C
compiler.  Then just:

`pip install python-lzo`

## Windows

There is an issue filed to provide a pre-compiled wheel to greatly
simplify this.

Until then, here we go:
* Download http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/download/lzo-2.09.tar.gz
* extract that file to `c:\src\` (should produce `c:\src\lzo-2.09` )
* Install a visual studio compatible with your python build.  If you are using
  python 2.7, MS has a package just for you at: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266
  Current automated tests are done with Visual Studio 2013, but newer should work as well.
* `python.exe setup.py install`

# Making a release

Check that the version number in `lzomodule.c`, `setup.py`, and `NEWS`
is correct.  Update release date in `NEWS`.

Make the release using the four steps below, then increment the
numbers in `lzomodule.c` and `setup.py` as well as start a new section
in `NEWS`.

## Source Package

python ./setup.py sdist
twine upload --repository-url https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/python-lzo-*.tar.gz

## macOS Wheel

**_TODO_**

## Windows Wheel

**_TODO_**

# Where's the documentation ?

Python-LZO comes with built-in documentation which is accessible
using `lzo.__doc__` and `lzo.func__doc__`. See ["Chapter 3: Data Model"
in the Python Reference Manual](https://docs.python.org/3.6/reference/datamodel.html) for more information.

Additionally you should read the docs and study the example
programs that ship with the LZO library. Really.

# Notes

The Windows version is tested.

It is not currently tested on OSX, but that is coming.
